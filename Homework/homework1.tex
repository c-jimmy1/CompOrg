\subsection{Textbook Problem 4.15.5}
Consider three different processors P1, P2, and P3 executing the same instruction set. P1 has a 3 GHz clock rate and a CPI of 1.5. P2 has a 2.5 GHz clock rate and a CPI of 1.0. P3 has a 4.0 GHz clock rate and has a CPI of 2.2.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Which processor has the highest performance expressed in instructions per second?
Answer:
\begin{center}

\end{center}
\item If the processors each execute a program in 10 seconds, find the number of cycles and the number of instructions.
\item We are trying to reduce the execution time by 30\% but this leads to an increase of 20\% in the CPI. What clock rate should we have to get this time reduction?
\end{enumerate}
